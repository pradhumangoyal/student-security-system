# student-security-system
Verifying every student that enters and exits the hostel is an extremely tedious task and hence, ends up being almost neglected. This in turn hampers the security of the residents in the hostel. Student Security System will be a portable and a wearable device comprising of a camera module, a processing unit, and a projector. The system will detect the presence of the student by face detection and will compare the face with existing dataset trained by the administration. By implementing a Face Recognition System to identify students and project their details, the guard wouldnâ€™t have to go through the tedious task of checking each student's details. The Project will also include an application to ease the process of taking and verifying the late/long leave taken by a student. If the student arrives late, an alert will be generated for the administration (Hostel attendant here).
